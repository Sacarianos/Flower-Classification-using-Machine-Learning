Project Overview
In this project, we explore the application of machine learning techniques for the classification of flower species. We use the Iris dataset, which includes measurements of different flower species, and apply various machine learning algorithms to accurately classify the flowers.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Iris dataset, which is publicly available and commonly used for classification tasks. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset includes three species: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica.

Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python and the required libraries installed. You can install the necessary libraries using the following command:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
git clone https://github.com/Sacarianos/Flower-Classification-using-Machine-Learning.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
cd Flower-Classification-using-Machine-Learning
Run the Jupyter Notebook to execute the project:

bash
jupyter notebook Flower_Classification.ipynb
Model Training
In the Jupyter Notebook, you will find the steps for data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training. The following machine learning algorithms are used in this project:

Logistic Regression

Decision Trees

Random Forest

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Evaluation
The trained models are evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Confusion matrices are also generated to visualize the performance of the models.

Results
The results of the classification models are summarized in the notebook, including the comparison of different algorithms based on their performance metrics. The best-performing model is identified and its performance is highlighted.
